## What next?

- Now that you have an understanding of the way Git and GitHub works, you could start using it for all your projects.

- When you create a project, don't forget to tell people about it, and send them links to your GitHub repos. That way they can use your code and maybe even help to make it better.

- Why not find a project that you could help out with on GitHub? You can help with anything from improving the code and the documentation to fixing little typos.
