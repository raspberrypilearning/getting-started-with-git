# Installing Git on Mac OS

Getting Git set up on Mac OS is easy, and has the added benefit of giving you a package manager to install lots of other awesome and open-source software.

1. You're going to need to start by typing a command into a terminal window on Mac OS. This will install the [Homebrew package manager](https://brew.sh/), which is pretty similar to **apt** on Linux.

1. Open up a terminal window by typing `Cmd + Space` to open Spotlight and then type `terminal` into the search field.

1. Now copy and past the following command into the terminal window to install Homebrew.

	```bash
	/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
	```

1. You can hit `Return` at the prompts and allow Homebrew to install. Once it is finished, you'll have Git installed on Mac OS, as it's an integral part of Homebrew. You can return to the [main worksheet](worksheet.md), and carry on following the guide.

1. As an added bonus, you now have an amazing package manager which you can use to install software. For instance, you can install Emacs just by typing `brew install emacs` into a terminal window.
