## GitHub issues

Our copy editors at Raspberry Pi are pretty amazing, so the chances of you spotting a typo in this resource are pretty slim. You might spot a mistake in some of the code though, and that's where you can help out. Take this bit of code for example:

```python
print("Hello World!")
```

Let's see how you could help fix this error.
