## Collaborative working

The true power of services like GitHub becomes apparent when you start working with other people. GitHub lets other people make their own copies of your projects, or you to make copies of theirs. Either of you can then make improvements to the project and then push the improvements up to GitHub for everyone to share.

This resource is itself a GitHub repo. You can find it at [https://github.com/raspberrypilearning/getting-started-with-git](https://github.com/raspberrypilearning/getting-started-with-git). That means that if you found a mistake in the resource, or if you just wanted to make some improvements, you can. There are two main ways to get involved with other people's projects: **issues** and **pull requests**.
