# Installing Git on Windows

The easiest way to install Git on Windows is to use GitHub's application. If you do not already have a GitHub account, you should begin by setting one up, as this will make things easier later on.

1. Register for an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/join?source=header-home), and choose the free plan.

1. Head over to [desktop.github.com](https://desktop.github.com/) and click on the **Download** button to download the GitHub app.

1. Once the file has downloaded, double click on the `.exe` file and follow the onscreen instructions to install. Near the end of the registration, you'll need to use your GitHub credentials to log in, and then proceed through the rest of the steps.

1. Once the setup has completed, you should see two new icons on your desktop and in your Application menu.

1. Although you can use the graphical version of the GitHub app, if you want to follow the rest of the [worksheet](worksheet.md), then you should use the **Git shell** app, which is a command line interface (CLI), to use Git. This way, you'll feel comfortable working on other operating systems, and you will also learn a little Bash (Bourne-again shell).

1. As the GitHub app has configured your username and email address, you can skip the **Setting up Git** section of the main worksheet.
