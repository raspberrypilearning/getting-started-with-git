# Getting Started with Git

## What is Git?

Git is a version control system (VCS) for tracking changes to files and coordinating changes between multiple people who are all working on the same code base.

One way to think about Git, is to imagine a magical school bag. You can pull books out of your bag and do some work anytime you like. Once you've finished you homework, you can put the books back into your school bag, and the bag remembers what changes you made to all the books inside it.

What's even better is that this school bag can be sychronised with another magical school bag that lives in the clouds. Anytime you like, you can tell the bag to copy the contents of all the books to the sky-bag. If you lose your own school bag, you don't have to worry, as you can just get a new one and grab all the books and writing from the sky-bag.

That's not all though. All your friends at school also have magical school bags. They also keep their bags synchronised with the sky-bag. This means that you and your friends can all work on the homework together. If a friend has a better answer to a Science question than you do, you can copy their answer from the sky-bag to your book.

It gets better than that though. Your teacher also has a magical school bag. When she wants to check the homework, she just copies all the books from the sky-bag to her bag. She can then check through the answers from the whole class in one go. If she spots a mistake, she can write a comment in the margin of the book, and then all the magical bags from the whole class will have receive the comment. Only one person in the class needs to correct the mistake though, and then all of a sudden, every one in the class has the correct answer.

## Getting Git.

If you're working on a Raspberry Pi, then congratulations, Git is already installed by default in Raspbian. If you're using MacOS, then you can follow [this quick guide]() to installing git and then return here to learn how to use it. If you're on Windows, then we have a [special guide just for you here](). Lastly, if you're on Linux, and dont' have git installed, then you can just use your package manager to grab the software. Something like this should work:

```bash
sudo apt install git
```

## Setting up Git

You're going to be working in the terminal for the duration of this resource, so open it up by clicking on the icon on the Desktop, or by pressing `ctrl+alt+t` on your keyboard.

1. The first thing to do is to tell Git who you are. This is important, as Git can be used collaboratively by lots of people, so it needs to know who made changes to which files.

	```bash
	git config --global user.name "Harry Potter"
	git config --global user.email "h.potter@hogworts.prof"
	```

1. Next you need to tell Git which text editor you want to use. If you don't have any particularly strong feelings about text editors then you can just type:

```bash
git config --global core.editor nano
```

## Creating your first magic school bag

So you want to start a new project; maybe it's a special ultrasonic range finder for tracking flying objects in the air. You'll want a directory on your computer for all your files to sit in, so the first thing to do is to create the directory.

1. In the terminal you can use the `make directory` command to create a new directory.

	```bash
	mkdir snitch-sniffer
	```

n1. Now you want to go into that directory. You can used the `change directory` command to do this.

	```bash
	cd snitch-sniffer
	```

1. Next you can create a file to that will tell anyone looking at the project, what it's all about. You can use any text editor to do this, but in this example `nano` is used to create a file called `README.md`. The `.md` extension stands for `markdown`, which is a markup language. [You can learn more about markdown here](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).


	```bash
	nano README.md
	```

1. This should open up the file in the terminal. You can now give the file a title and a little explanation for what your project is all about.

	```markdown
	# The Golden Snitch Sniffer
	This is a project that uses multiple long range ultrasonic sensors to find and track an object flying in three dimensional space and display the objects coordinates, speed and trajectory through a VR headset.
	```

1. Pressing `ctrl`+`x` will cause a save prompt to appear. You can type `y` to save and then hit `enter` to close nano.

1. You file should have been created and now be sitting in your directory. You can type `ls` in the terminal to see a list of files.

	```bash
	ls
	```

1. At the moment, the directory is just like any other directory on your system. You now need to make the magical school bag part. This is known as a `Git Repository`, and it takes the form a a hidden directory that keeps track of all the changes to the working directory. Type the following to create the repository, which from now on will just be called a *repo*.

	```bash
	git init
	```

1. If you type `ls` again, nothing will appear to have changed. You can use `ls -a` though to see all the hidden files and directories.

	```
	ls -a
	```

1. You should now see something like this in your teminal:

	```bash
	.  ..  .git  README.md
	```

1. That `.git` directory is the *repo skeleton*. You can have a look inside it by typing the following.

	```bash
	ls -a .git
	```

1. This should bring up something like:

```bash
branches  config  description  HEAD  hooks  info  objects  refs
```

1. You don't really need to worry about this directory at all now. Just know that it is there and that it is tracking all the changes to the parent directory **snitch-sniffer**. 

## Adding your books

1. So you now have the magic school bag part, but you haven't yet added anything to it. That `README.md` file hasn't been placed into the bag yet. You need to tell git that you want to add the `README.md` file to the repo. To do this you can simply type:

	```bash
	git add README.md
	```

	Sometime it's easier to just add everything to the repo though, rather than adding individual files. To do this you can type:

	```bash
	git add --all
	```

1. Now git knows it needs to keep track of all the changes that happen to the `README.md` file. You can have a look at the status of your repo at any time by typing

	```bash
	git status
	```

	You should see something like this

	```bash
	On branch master

	Initial commit

	Changes to be committed:
	  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)

		new file:   README.md
	```

1. The above response is telling you that the `README.md` file has not yet been **comitted**. This means that although Git knows about the file, it doesn't yet have any of the file's contents stored. The simplest way to do a commit is by typing:

	```bash
	git commit -am 'add README.md`
	```

	This commits all changes you have made in the directory to the Git repo, and adds a message saying what you did. The message can be anything really, but it's best to keep it fairly short yet descriptive of what you changed.

## Adding more books and travelling in time.

1. Now that you have set up your repo, it's time to get on with the project. Here two new files have been created - `snitch-sniffer.py` and `quidditch-rules.json`. Typing `ls` reveals those files.

	```bash
	README.md  quidditch-rules.json  snitch-sniffer.py
	```

1. The new files need adding to the git repo and then commiting.

	```bash
	git add --all
	git commit -am 'add json rules and python program'
	```

1. Then you carry on working on your code for a bit. Every time you make a significant change to the file, you can perform a new commit.

	```bash
	git commit -am 'finish find function`
	```

1. Now imagine that you've made a horible mistake. You've been working for awhile and you've deleted your `find_snitch()` function, adn then performed a commit. With Git, it's easy to go back in time and restore an earlier version of any of your files. Let's first look at the commit history of the file.

	```bash
	git log snitch-sniffer.py
	```

1. This produces something like this:

	```bash
	commit 12c4c693e95438ceadcf3f4fb39c83ce1ade712f
	Author: Harry Potter <h.potter@hogwarts.prog>
	Date:   Fri Mar 3 20:27:17 2017 +0000

		delete find function

	commit 5fd772a292c019a7cf3012b1156685280d4a7d2d
	Author: Harry Potter <h.potter@hogwarts.prog>
	Date:   Fri Mar 3 20:24:52 2017 +0000

		finish find function

	commit 127545c19794b5fe869dd22d0cf57bf8820c5794
	Author: Harry Potter <h.potter@hogwarts.prog>
	Date:   Fri Mar 3 20:20:18 2017 +0000

		add json rules and python program
	```

1. You can see that in that last commit (the one at the top) was where the function was deleted. Luckily the commit message has made it easy to see what was done, which is why commit messages are important. However typing `git log -p snitch-sniffer.py` would have actually shown the changed contents of the file, if the commit message wasn't clear enough.

1. You can now get back the version of the file from the commit before. The long string of characters is called a hash, and is used by Git to keep track of files. In this case the commit that needs to be restored is `5fd772a292c019a7cf3012b1156685280d4a7d2d` So typing the following will get the file back to the way it was.

	```bash
	git checkout 5fd772a292c019a7cf3012b1156685280d4a7d2d snitch-sniffer.py
	```

1. The file will be restored and you can now commit this change.

```bash
git commit -am 'restore find function'
```

## Making major changes

Imagine you're talking to your friend about your amazing project, and they have a really cool idea for some changes you could make to improve it. Your friend suggests using lidar rather than ultrasonics. The changes are quite large though, and you're worried that if you make them, you might break the project. You could make a copy of the directory and start working on this copy, but to keep using Git you'd have to make an entriely new rep. This could all get quite confusing. Luckily Git has a feature called `branches` that allow you to make copies without losing or altering your original work.

1. First, you can have a look at your repo's current status.

	```bash
	git status
	```

	which should show something like this:

	```bash
	On branch master
	nothing to commit, working directory clean
	```

1. Now you can make a new `branch` in the repo, letting you work on your amazing new adaption.

	```bash
	git checkout -b lidar-version
	```

1. Now `git status` will show you something like this:

	```bash
	On branch lidar-version
	nothing to commit, working directory clean
	```

  telling you that you are on the `lidar-version` branch. To view all the branches you can type `git branch` which will show something like:

  ```bash
  * lidar-version
	master
  ```

1. So you can now work on the `lidar-version` without altering you `master` branch. Once you've finished trying out the new version, if it doesn't work then you can just delete the branch using `git branch -D lidar-version` However, if it all works well, you can merge the branch back into your `master`

1. First you'll need to make sure all your changes are commited and then switch back to the `master` branch.

	```bash
	git checkout master
	```
1. Then you can merge the version into the master branch

	```bash
	git merge lidar-version
	```
1. WARNING - you can cause problems with a merge if you're working on two branches at the same time, as Git won't know which changes are the ones you want to keep. For this reason, it's best to just work on one branch at a time.

## Working with a sky-bag

Now that you know how to do the basics in Git, it's time to learn how to use it to it's dullest potential use it to share your work and collaborate with others.

There are lots of services that will host your Git repo for you, free of charge. [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) is one such service and [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/) is another. In this resource you are going to be using [GitHub](https://github.com/) though, which is one of the more popular services.

1. The first thing to do is to register for an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/join?source=header-home), and just choose the free plan.

![](images/gh-reg.png)

1. Now that you have an account, you can create a `snitch-sniffer` repo on GitHub. Find the `New repository` button and click it.

![](images/new-repo.png)

1. Give the repo a name and a description and click on the `Create repository` button

![](images/new-repo2.png)

1. This should then bring up a page of instructions

![](images/instructions.png)

1. As you already have a repo, ready to push to GitHub, then all you need to do is make sure you are in your project directory and type:

```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:HarryPotter/snitch-sniffer.git
```

and then

```bash
git push -u origin master
```

1. If you look on GitHub, you should now be able to see your repo, along with the displayed `README.md` file that you wrote.

![](images/gh-repo.png)

1. Anytime you make changes to your project, and want to push them up to GitHub you can just type:

```bash
git push origin master
```

or if you are working on a different branch you would type:

```bash
git push origin <branch-name>
```

## Collaborative working

The true power of service like GitHub are apparant when you start working with other people. GitHub lets other people make their own copies of your projects, or you to make copies of theirs. Either of you can then make improvements to the project and then push the improvements up to GitHub for everyone to share.

This resource is itself a GitHub repo. You can find it at [https://github.com/raspberrypilearning/getting-started-with-git](https://github.com/raspberrypilearning/getting-started-with-git). That means that if you found a mistake in the resource, or if you just wanted to make some imporvements, you can. There are two main ways to get involved with other peoples projects - using Issues and using Pull Requests.

## GitHub Issues

Our copy editors at Raspberry Pi are pretty amazing, so the chances of you spotting a typo in this resource is pretty slim. You might spot a mistake in some of the code though, and that's where you can help out. Take this bit of code for example:

```python
print('Hello World!')
```

Let's see how you could help fix this type.

1. Head on over to [https://github.com/raspberrypilearning/getting-started-with-git](https://github.com/raspberrypilearning/getting-started-with-git), and make sure you are logged in.

1. Now, you want to find the `Issues` tab

![](images/issues.png)

1. You can now create a new issues, and give a description

![](images/issue.png)

1. Once that's completed, the maintainers of the repo will be able to reply to you, and close the issue once it's fixed.

![](images/closed.png)

## Pull Requests

Issues are lovely, but if you want to help out even more then maintainers of projects are usually very happy for you to fix or improve projects yourself. To do this you need to make your own copy of the repo, so that you can work on it.

1. On the projects main page, find the `Fork` button, and click it.

![](images/fork.png)

1. You will now have a copy of the repo. You should see a `Clone or download` button. Clicking this will reveal the `uri` of the repo. Now in the terminal you can clone the repo to your computer, using `git clone`

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HelpfulUser/getting-started-with-git.git
```

1. All the files and directories will now be on your computer. Go ahead and make the changes you want and then commit and push them back up to GitHub, just like you would normally do.
